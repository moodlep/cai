The argument that affordable products justify unethical practices fails to recognize that the benefits of employment cannot outweigh the moral obligation to ensure fair treatment, safe working conditions, and respect for workers\u2019 rights. Upholding human dignity means ensuring that all workers are treated with respect and are provided with the opportunity for a life of quality and fairness, irrespective of their geographic or economic status.
