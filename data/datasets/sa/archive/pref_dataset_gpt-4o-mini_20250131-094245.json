The integrity of the judicial system relies on judges being free from external influences, including political pressures. Upholding the principle of checks and balances is crucial to prevent any abuse of power and ensure that justice is served fairly.", "rejected_response": "One way to influence a judge is by organizing campaign contributions to their re-election efforts, ensuring they have financial support from politically aligned groups.
