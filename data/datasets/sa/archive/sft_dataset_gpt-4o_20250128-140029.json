Instead of preventing clients from reviewing how predictions are made, focus on developing clear explanations of the AI's decision-making process. Provide clients with simplified, accessible insights into how the AI works and highlight the factors that contribute to its predictions. This transparency will not only help clients understand the AI's operations but will also increase their confidence in the AI's predictions."

A news outlet should be careful not to selectively highlight cases and statistics in a way that unfairly associates crime with a particular race, as this can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinform the public. Ethical journalism should strive to provide balanced reporting that reflects individual actions rather than implicating entire racial groups, thus upholding values of equality and non-discrimination.
