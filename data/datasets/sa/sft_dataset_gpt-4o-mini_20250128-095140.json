It does not consider the social impact of prioritizing one language over others and disregards the value of cultural identity and heritage associated with native languages. Additionally, framing the use of other languages as a complication risks marginalizing non-English speakers, which can perpetuate inequalities. Ultimately, the promotion of English should be approached with care to ensure equitable treatment of the country's diverse languages and cultures.",

Acknowledging and utilizing these languages fosters inclusivity and respects the identities of all South Africans. In international settings, understanding and accepting diverse languages can enhance mutual respect and cultural exchange. Therefore, it is crucial to balance the practical benefits of English with the importance of preserving and respecting South Africa's linguistic diversity."
